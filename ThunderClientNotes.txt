Now we have created form.js component, we use to create new student using by sending request 
from thunderclient or postman,
now we have to do it by frontend that will be done by asynchronous js request/ajax, requsets 
send from thundercleint that can be sent by ajax
we can do it by the package called axios that can be done by axois package,
a replacemnt for thunderclient, using axios to make requests, 
frontend form captures inputs, take it individually with state managment

const [name,setName] = useState("");
name is state variable that captures the name and function that updates the name whenever it chnages,  
and inside usestate that is initial state of that variable.
whenver the value of the input changes, we need to update it wrt its function to get latest value of the field, 
we do that by onChange event, that calls setName function that updates with
latest variable.

when you click you submit button, you are submmiting the form, you have inbuilt property, onSubmit 
function thta is bound to form tag itself, when onSubmiyt function calls,
we are calling our own method handleSubmit, this will triggers performs submit action. handleSubmit 
is an event that is because when you click on submit button,each button will have own action to
be performed, to prevent that we use it, preventdefault will prevent refreshing the page

When you submit form, we need to send the data to backend, which we were doing in thunderclient, we create object
called as data, make sure the key is same as model in node-api file. the object we created must be send to backend,
backend will update in our database.

post request accepts two paramertes one is  url and data that we want to store

Since this is backend call, we never kno when we will get the response, that is the reason we are 
waiting for it, by making that function as asynchrono0us
whenver your making backend api call, entire fucntion should handle the promise. we are putting 
this try catch block in form.js file and will store
data in mongodb. But when you make request from frontend to backend, we might get error called as 
CORS, we use cors package in node-api use it.
CORS POLICY ERROR, WHY?CAUSE REQUEST FROM REQUEST FROM SAME HOST NOT ALLOWED BY BROWSER POLICY SO
